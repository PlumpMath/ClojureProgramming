목표는 데이터 유형을 사례에 따라 정의하는 데 있으며 여기에서는 기존 코드를 재컴파일하지 않으면서 그리고 정적 유형을 안전하게 유지하면서 새 케이스를 데이터 유형에 추가하고 데이터 유형 전체에 새 함수를 추가할 수 있다.

## Extending to Existing Types 266

## Defining Your Own Types 270
(deftype
(defrecord


clojure의 type이 자바 class로 컴파일 되므로, 이름은 보통 CamelCase로 짖는다.
(defrecord Point [x y])
(deftype Point [x y])
(.x (Point. 3 4))
;= 3

(defrecord NamedPoint [^String name ^long x ^long y])
(NamedPoint/getBasis)
;= [name x y]
(map meta (NamedPoint/getBasis))
;= ({:tag String} {:tag long} {:tag long})

We’ll focus on records first: they are designed to be used to model and represent application-
level data,7 whereas deftype types are intended to define low-level infrastructure
types, such as when you are implementing a new data structure.

The differences between the two facilities lie entirely with the defaults that records
provide in terms of interoperating with the rest of Clojure and certain Java facilities,
and certain capabilities that deftype provides that make it possible to optimize the lowlevel
operations that they’re designed to address.


because they are host classes, not vars. You have to explicitly import defined types

(def x "hello")
;= #'user/hello
(defrecord Point [x y])
;= user.Point
(Point. 5 5)
;= #user.Point{:x 5, :y 5}
(ns user2)
(refer 'user)
x
;= "hello"
Point
;= CompilerException java.lang.Exception:
;= Unable to resolve symbol: Point
(import 'user.Point)
Point
;= user.Point









## Records 272

defrecord is really
just a macro that builds on top of deftype.


types defined by defrecord are a specialization of those defined
by deftype
Value semantics
Full participation in the associative collection abstraction
Metadata support
Reader support, so instances of record types can be created by simply reading data
An additional convenience constructor for creating records with metadata and auxiliary fields as desired


#### Records are associative collections.
(:x (Point. 3 4))
;= 3
(:z (Point. 3 4) 0)
;= 0
(map :x [(Point. 3 4)
(Point. 5 6)
(Point. 7 8)])
;= (3 5 7)


(:z (assoc (Point. 3 4) :z 5))
;= 5
(.z (assoc (Point. 3 4) :z 5))
;= #<java.lang.IllegalArgumentException:
;= No matching field found: z for class user.Point>


#### Metadata support.
(-> (Point. 3 4)
(with-meta {:foo :bar})
meta)
;= {:foo :bar}

#### Readable representation.
(pr-str (assoc (Point. 3 4) :z [:a :b]))
;= "#user.Point{:x 3, :y 4, :z [:a :b]}"
(= (read-string *1)
(assoc (Point. 3 4) :z [:a :b]))


#### Auxiliary constructor.
(Point. 3 4 {:foo :bar} {:z 5})
;= #user.Point{:x 3, :y 4, :z 5}
(meta *1)
;= {:foo :bar}

(-> (Point. 3 4)
(with-meta {:foo :bar})
(assoc :z 5))

#### Constructors and factory functions
(->Point 3 4)
;= #user.Point{:x 3, :y 4}

(map->Point {:x 3, :y 4, :z 5})
;= #user.Point{:x 3, :y 4, :z 5}


(map (partial apply ->Point) [[5 6] [7 8] [9 10]])
;= (#user.Point{:x 5, :y 6}
;= #user.Point{:x 7, :y 8}
;= #user.Point{:x 9, :y 10})
(map map->Point [{:x 1 :y 2} {:x 5 :y 6 :z 44}])
;= (#user.Point{:x 1, :y 2}
;= #user.Point{:x 5, :y 6, :z 44})


(Point/create {:x 3, :y 4, :z 5})
;= #user.Point{:x 3, :y 4, :z 5}

#### When to use maps or records

Maps are the simplest way to get started writing code and modeling data because maps
do not force you to predefine any types or schema at all, thus giving you more conceptual
latitude when prototyping a feature.

However, as soon as you perceive the need
for type-based polymorphism (available via protocols for records and types) or performance-
sensitive field access, you can switch to records and be done: most of your code
(if not all) will work as is because of the abstractions shared between maps and records


One pitfall when switching from maps to records is that records are not functions.
Another trap is that maps and records can never be equal,








## Types 277

(deftype Point [x y])
;= user.Point
(.x (Point. 3 4))
;= 3
(:x (Point. 3 4))
;= nil
deftype types are not associative,11 and so the most common pattern of using keywords
as accessor functions is unavailable.



^:volatile-mutable or ^:unsynchronized-mutable

	
“Volatile” here has the same meaning as the volatile field modifier in Java: reads and
writes are atomic12 and must be executed in program order; i.e., they cannot be reordered
by the JIT compiler or by the CPU. Volatiles are thus unsurprising and threadsafe—
but uncoordinated and still entirely open to race conditions.
On the other hand, an unsynchronized field is a “regular” Java mutable field whose use
will be thread-safe only under the guard of a lock13…or in the most expert of hands.
While immutable fields are public, mutable fields are always private and only accessible
from within method bodies provided inline with the type definition.





## Implementing Protocols 280

1. Provide implementations for protocol methods when a type is initially defined via `deftype` or `defrecord`; this is called inline implementation.
2. Use the extend* functions to register implementations for a type with the protocol.

(defrecord Point [x y]
Matrix
(lookup [pt i j]
(when (zero? j)
(case i
0 x
1 y)))
(update [pt i j value]
(if (zero? j)
(condp = i
0 (Point. value y)
1 (Point. x value))
pt))
(rows [pt] [[x] [y]])
(cols [pt] [[x y]])
(dims [pt] [2 1]))



(defrecord Point [x y])
(extend-protocol Matrix
Point
(lookup [pt i j]
(when (zero? j)
(case i
0 (:x pt)
1 (:y pt))))
(update [pt i j value]
(if (zero? j)
(condp = i
0 (Point. value (:y pt))
1 (Point. (:x pt) value))
pt))
(rows [pt]
[[(:x pt)] [(:y pt)]])
(cols [pt]
[[(:x pt) (:y pt)]])
(dims [pt] [2 1]))

while when you provide inline implementations, you can
directly refer to field values by their name since they are in the lexical scope.











## Inline Implementation 281
Generally, inline implementations provide better performance for two reasons: they
have direct access to the type’s fields, and calling protocol methods will be as fast as
calling an interface method in Java



Because each protocol is backed by a Java interface, implementing a protocol’s methods
inline results in a class that implements the protocol’s corresponding interface, where
you define that class’s method bodies in those inline implementations.



defrecord automatically
provides implementations, including java.util.Map, java.io.Serializable,
clojure.lang.IPersistentMap


(defrecord R []
ClashWhenInlined
(size [x]))
;= #<CompilerException java.lang.ClassFormatError:
;= Duplicate method name&signature in class file user/R,
compiling:(NO_SOURCE_PATH:1)>
(defrecord R [])
;= user.R
(extend-type R
ClashWhenInlined
(size [x]))
;= nil
All is well when we use extend-type to register an implementation for our record
type with the protocol, because that extension does not impact the construction of
the R type—it isn’t retroactively modified to implement the interface backing the
protocol.





Besides defrecord and deftype there is one other construct that accepts inline implementations:
reify.

Instances created by reify form closures, leaving method implementation bodies with
direct access to any local in the lexical scope.
(reify
Protocol-or-Interface-or-Object
(method1 [this x]
(implementation))
Another-Protocol-or-Interface
(method2 [this x y]
(implementation))
(method3 [this x]
(implementation)))

* reify is simpler: its method implementations are “baked in” just like those provided to deftype and defrecord forms, so dynamic updates are not directly supported.
* reify is more limited: it can only satisfy protocols and implement methods of Java interfaces and Object. Concrete classes may not be subclassed, whether they are abstract or not.
* Because all of reify’s method implementations are inlined into the host class, calls to those methods have zero overhead.

## Protocol Dispatch Edge Cases 290

Competing implementations.
 The fact that protocols can be extended at any time
and at runtime is a huge boon to interactive development and for allowing protocol
implementations to evolve to accommodate tricky modeling or optimization problems.
 However, if two implementations of the same protocol for the same type exist,
then the last implementation that was loaded will replace the first—potentially to surprising
effect if the implementation you expect happens to be loaded first.
Alas, this is a problem of policy rather than technology! The rule of thumb to avoid
such conflicts is: if you are neither the protocol or type owner, be prepared to retract
your implementation. The potential conflict between the two owners is usually settled
by chronology: when the protocol predates the type, it’s the type owner’s responsibility
to extend the protocol and vice versa.


Class hierarchies break “ties” when possible.
(defprotocol P
(a [x]))
;= P
(extend-protocol P
java.util.Collection
(a [x] :collection!)
java.util.List
(a [x] :list!))
;= nil
(a [])
;= :list!



Unresolvable “ties” choose an arbitrary implementation.
(defprotocol P
(a [x]))
(extend-protocol P
java.util.Map
(a [x] :map!)
java.io.Serializable
(a [x] :serializable!))

(a {})
;= :serializable!


1. Extend the protocol to concrete types that you know you want to support. There
is never any ambiguity of dispatch between concrete types.
2. Wanting to extend multiple unrelated high-level interfaces to a protocol may be a
sign of a design problem, where the contract of the protocol is too broad. Revisit
that contract.
3. Use multimethods. In contrast to protocols, multimethods do fail with an error if
a call results in an unresolvable tie between dispatch values. Further, multimethods
provide a “preference” mechanism that can be used to specify how to resolve such
ambiguity.

## Final Thoughts 299

Types, records, and protocols together shape a potent framework that puts the focus
on data and avoids extraneous ceremony and complexity. This data-centric approach
to types and abstractions allows us to model domains and interactions more faithfully,
apply the whole language to those models—such as how we can work with records and
maps in a uniform way using the core collection and associative abstractions and functions—
and helps us to avoid having to make false choices due to often unnecessary
complexities like class hierarchies.
